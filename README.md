This is a pet project created to demonstrate machine learning skills in the field of deepfake detection. The project is currently under active development and not yet fully complete.

Topic
=====

Deepfakes are becoming a major concern with the growing popularity of AI-generated content. Detecting deepfakes is essential to prevent fraud, misinformation, and other potential threats.

This project explores Fourier-based analysis (FFT) as a method for detecting periodic artifacts often present in deepfake images. The core of the model is a CNN architecture trained on FFT maps extracted from facial images.

The implementation is inspired by the Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing project (https://github.com/minivision-ai/Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing/tree/master), which was originally designed for face spoofing detection.


Instructions on the following features will be added soon:

- How to train and validate the model

- How to convert the model to OpenVINO format

- How to tune hyperparameters using Optuna
